| platform | dataset | device | gemm | classes | batches | train img/s | final loss | infer img/s | infer img/s (with decode) | top-1 | top-5 | majority-class baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cpu | cifar10-full | CPU | cpu | 10 | 20 | 13.3 | 1.9399 | 87.1 | 87.0 | 0.1540 | 0.5163 | 0.1000 |

`infer img/s` is the network forward pass alone; the next column
includes JPEG/PNG decode and centre-cropping, which is what an
end-to-end pipeline actually costs. The last column is what you would
score by always guessing the validation set's most common class.
Throughput is per-image, so it compares across rows; top-1 only
compares between rows that trained for the same number of batches.
